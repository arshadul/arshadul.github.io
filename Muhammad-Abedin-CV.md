## About

Senior Software Engineer with 15+ years of experience building scalable backend systems across payments, search, data infrastructure, and telecommunications.

Most recently at Coursera, I led efforts to modernize and optimize the financial reporting pipeline for the Payments team, improving performance and reliability using Apache Spark. I partnered closely with infrastructure and finance teams, contributed to GDPR/SOC2 initiatives, managed quarterly SOX compliance, and integrated global payment providers including Stripe, Braintree, Razorpay, and eBanx.

Previously at BloomReach, I worked on large-scale commerce search systems—designing data pipelines, relevance ranking algorithms, and product ontology frameworks using Java, Hadoop, Lucene/Solr, and Cassandra.

My background also includes research in NLP, security, and software fault localization, as well as experience in teaching and telecom systems architecture.

I focus on building reliable distributed systems, optimizing data workflows, and delivering high-impact engineering solutions that bridge technical depth with business needs.

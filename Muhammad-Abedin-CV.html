<h2 id="about">About</h2>
<p>Senior Software Engineer with 15+ years of experience building
scalable backend systems across payments, search, data infrastructure,
and telecommunications.</p>
<p>Most recently at Coursera, I led efforts to modernize and optimize
the financial reporting pipeline for the Payments team, improving
performance and reliability using Apache Spark. I partnered closely with
infrastructure and finance teams, contributed to GDPR/SOC2 initiatives,
managed quarterly SOX compliance, and integrated global payment
providers including Stripe, Braintree, Razorpay, and eBanx.</p>
<p>Previously at BloomReach, I worked on large-scale commerce search
systems—designing data pipelines, relevance ranking algorithms, and
product ontology frameworks using Java, Hadoop, Lucene/Solr, and
Cassandra.</p>
<p>My background also includes research in NLP, security, and software
fault localization, as well as experience in teaching and telecom
systems architecture.</p>
<p>I focus on building reliable distributed systems, optimizing data
workflows, and delivering high-impact engineering solutions that bridge
technical depth with business needs.</p>
